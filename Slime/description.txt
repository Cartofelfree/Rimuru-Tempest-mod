This mod adds the Rimuru costume from the "That Time I Reincarnated as a Slime" anime. The mod is made by a beginner in modding and (so far) is nothing large-scale. I plan to add the ability to turn into slime in the future, but I do not promise anything since it is impossible to do this with my knowledge.
